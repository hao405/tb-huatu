# Role
You are an expert in Data Visualization and Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn). I need you to generate Python code to visualize experimental results for a Machine Learning project.

# Context
I have results from an ablation study and time-series model outputs. I need three specific plots.
Please use `matplotlib.pyplot` and ensuring the figures are publication-quality (high DPI, clear legends, grid lines).

# Input Data Assumption
Assume the data comes in as Numpy arrays or PyTorch tensors. Please generate **mock data** first to demonstrate the code is working.

## Task 1: Ablation Study (Bar Chart)
**Goal:** Visualize the performance metric (e.g., Loss or Accuracy) for 4 different loss function configurations.

**Configurations:**
1. **Full Model:** `y_loss + zc_loss + zd_loss + hmm_loss + rec_loss`
2. **No Latent Z:** `y_loss + hmm_loss + rec_loss`
3. **No HMM:** `y_loss + zc_loss + zd_loss + rec_loss`
4. **No Reconstruction:** `y_loss + zc_loss + zd_loss + hmm_loss`

**Requirements:**
- Create a **Bar Chart**.
- X-axis: The 4 configuration names (shortened names are okay, e.g., "Full", "w/o Z", "w/o HMM", "w/o Rec").
- Y-axis: The metric value (Low is better if it's Loss, High is better if Accuracy—let's assume "Loss" for now).
- Display the exact value on top of each bar.

## Task 2: Reconstruction & Prediction Analysis (Line Plot)
**Goal:** Compare the Input Feature ($x$), Ground Truth ($y$), and Reconstructed Output ($\hat{y}$).

**Data Requirements:**
- **x:** Input features (use the last dimension if multi-dimensional).
- **y_true:** Ground truth target.
- **y_pred:** Reconstructed/Predicted output.

**Visualization Requirements:**
- Plot these sequences as continuous lines.
- **Time Steps:** Focus on the first 96 time steps.
- **Vertical Line:** Draw a distinct **dashed vertical line** at `t=96`.
- The X-axis should represent time steps.
- Include a clear legend.

## Task 3: Latent State vs Input Feature (Dual-Axis Plot)
**Goal:** Visualize the estimated latent state $c_{est}$ alongside the input data to see their correlation.

**Data Requirements:**
- **c_est:** The estimated discrete latent variable (or sequence of states).
- **input_feature:** The last dimension of the input data.

**Visualization Requirements:**
- **Plot Type:** Continuous line plot.
- **Dual Y-Axis:** Since $c_{est}$ (likely integers or probabilities) and `input_feature` have different scales, use `ax.twinx()` to plot them on the same figure with different Y-scales.
- **Primary Y-axis:** `input_feature` (e.g., Blue line).
- **Secondary Y-axis:** $c_{est}$ (e.g., Red or Orange line).
- Ensure the two lines are visually distinct.

## Output Requirement
Please provide a single Python script that:
1. Generates dummy/mock data for all 3 tasks.
2. Creates a figure with 3 subplots (e.g., 3 rows, 1 column) OR 3 separate figures.
3. Implements the visualization logic described above.
